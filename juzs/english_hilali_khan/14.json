Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Prophet Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام emigrated with Sârah and entered a village where there was a king from amongst the kings or a tyrant from amongst the tyrants. (The king) was told that Ibrâhîm (Abraham) had entered (the village) accompanied by a woman who was one of the most charming women. So, the king sent for Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and asked, ‘O Ibrâhîm (Abraham)! Who is this lady accompanying you?’ Ibrâhîm (Abraham) replied, ‘She is my sister (i.e., in religion).’ Then Ibrâhîm (Abraham) returned to her and said, ‘Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them that you are my sister. By Allâh, there are not true believers on the earth except you and I.’ Then Ibrâhîm (Abraham) sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, offered Salât (prayer) and said, ‘O Allâh! If I have believed in You and Your Messenger, and have guarded my private parts from everybody except my husband, then please do not let this disbeliever overpower me.’ On that the king fell in a state of unconsciousness (or had an epileptic fit) and started moving his legs. Seeing the condition of the king, Sârah said, ‘O Allâh! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.’ The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up again and performed ablution, offered Salât (prayer) and said, ‘O Allâh! If I have believed in You and Your Messenger and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then please do not let this disbeliever overpower me.’ The king again fell in a state of unconsciousness (or had epileptic fit) and started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sârah said, ‘O Allâh! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.’ The king got either two or three attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said, ‘By Allâh! You have sent a Satan to me. Take her to Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and give her Agar (Hagar).’ So she came back to Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and said, ‘Allâh humiliated the disbeliever and gave us a slave-girl for service.’ \" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.3.

There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I. This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don’t contradict my statement.\" The tyrant then called Sârah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sârah, \"Pray to Allâh for me, and I shall not harm you.\" So Sârah asked Allâh to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again requested Sârah, \"Pray to Allâh for me, and I will not harm you,\" Sârah asked Allâh again and he became right. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and said, \"You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil.\" The tyrant then gave Hâjar as a girl-servant to Sârah. Sârah came back [to Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] while he was praying. Ibrâhîm (Abraham), gesturing with his hand, asked, \"What has happened?\" She replied \"Allâh has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and gave me Hâjar for service\". (Abu Hurairah then addressed his listeners saying, \"That (Hâjar) was your mother, O Banî Mâ’-is-Samâ’ (i.e. the Arabs).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.578)\n* The idolaters invited Ibrâhîm (Abraham) to join them in their celebrations outside the city, but he refused, claiming that he was sick. When he was left alone, he came to their idols and broke them into pieces.

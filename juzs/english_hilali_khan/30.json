If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).’ Then he hit (it) with the stone, and it was killed and the people passed (the road). The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him: ‘O my son! Today you are better than I; you have achieved what I see! And you will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.’ The boy used to treat the people suffering from born-blindness, leprosy, leucoderma, and other diseases. A blind courtier of the king heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said: ‘All these gifts are for you on condition that you cure me’. The boy said: ‘I do not cure anybody; it is only Allâh (Alone) Who cures (people). So if you believe in Allâh, and invoke Allâh, He will cure you’. He then believed in Allâh, and Allâh cured him. Later the courtier came to the king, and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king asked him: ‘Who has given you your sight back?’ The courtier replied: ‘My Lord (Allâh)!’ The king said: ‘Have you got another lord than I?’ The courtier said: ‘My Lord and your Lord is Allâh!’ The king got hold of him and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the boy. So the boy was brought. The king said to the boy: ‘O boy! Has your (knowledge of) sorcery reached to the extent that you cure born-blinds, lepers, leucodermic patients and do such and such?’ The boy replied: ‘I do not cure anybody; it is only Allâh (Alone) Who does cure’. Then the king got hold of him, and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the monk. And the monk was brought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The monk refused to turn apostate. Then the king ordered (to be bring) a saw, and it was put in the middle of his scalp and was sawn, till he fell. cut in two pieces. Then that courtier was brought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The courtier refused to turn apostate. So the saw was put in the middle of his scalp, and was sawn till he fell, cut in two pieces. Then the boy was brought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The boy refused to turn apostate. So the king ordered some of his courtiers to take the boy to such and such a mountain saying, ‘Then ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its top, and see if he turns apostate (from his religion, well and good); otherwise throw him down from its top.’ They took him, ascended up the mountain, and the boy said: ‘O Allâh! Save me from them by anything You wish!’ So the mountain shook and all of them fell down, and the boy came walking to the king. The king asked him: ‘What did your companions do?’ The boy said: ‘Allâh has saved me from them.’ The king then ordered some of his courtiers to take the boy on board a boat into the middle of the sea, saying, ‘Then if he turns apostate (from his religion, well and good), otherwise cast him into the sea.’ So they took him, and he said: ‘O Allâh! Save me from them by anything You wish.’ So the boat capsized, and (all the accompanying courtiers) were drowned. The boy then came walking to the king. The king said: ‘What did your companions do?’ The boy replied: ‘Allâh saved me from them’, and he further said to the king: ‘You cannot kill me till you do what I command!’ The king said: ‘What is that (command of yours)?’ The boy said: ‘Gather all the people in an upland place, and fasten me to the stem (of a tree); then take an arrow from my quiver and fix it in the bow, and say: - In the Name of Allâh, the Lord of the boy, - and shoot (me). If you do that, you will kill me.’ So the king gathered the people in an upland place, and fastened the boy to the stem, took an arrow from his quiver, fixed it in the bow, and said: ‘In the Name of Allâh, the Lord of the boy’, and shot the arrow. The arrow hit the temporal region of the skull of the boy, and the boy put his hand over the temporal region of his skull at the point where the arrow hit, and then died. The people proclaimed: ‘We have believed in the Lord of the boy! We have believed in the Lord of the boy! We have believed in the Lord of the boy!’ The king came, and it was said to him: ‘That is the thing which you were afraid of. By Allâh! The thing which you were afraid of, has fallen upon you, the people have believed (in Allâh).’ So he ordered (deep) ditches to be dug at the entrances of the roads, and it was done, then fire was kindled in those ditches, and the king ordered that whoever did not turn apostate (from his religion) be cast into the ditches, and it was done. Then there came a woman with her babe. She nearly retreated back from the ditch but the babe said (spoke): ‘O mother! Be patient, you are on the Truth,’ (So she threw herself in the ditch of the fire along with her child to be with the martyrs in the Paradise).\" (Sahih Muslim, Vol.4, Hadith No.7148).","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"qutila aṣḥābu al-ukh'dūdi ","translations":["Destroyed were","(the) companions","(of) the pit","(4)"],"transliterationArr":["qutila","aṣḥābu","al-ukh'dūdi",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,650],[2,650,1610],[3,1610,5935]]}},{"name":"85:5","price":" 5. Of fire fed with fuel,","arabic":"ٱلنَّارِ ذَاتِ ٱلۡوَقُودِ","category":["85 (Al-Buruj)","Al-Buruj","Surah Al-Buruj"],"ayahNumber":5914,"juzNumber":30,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"al-nāri dhāti al-waqūdi ","translations":["(Of) the fire","full","(of) the fuel","(5)"],"transliterationArr":["al-nāri","dhāti","al-waqūdi",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,2120],[2,2120,2760],[3,2760,6735]]}},{"name":"85:6","price":" 6. When they sat by it (fire),","arabic":"إِذۡ هُمۡ عَلَيۡهَا قُعُودٞ","category":["85 (Al-Buruj)","Al-Buruj","Surah Al-Buruj"],"ayahNumber":5915,"juzNumber":30,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"idh hum ʿalayhā quʿūdun ","translations":["When","they","by it","(were) sitting","(6)"],"transliterationArr":["idh","hum","ʿalayhā","quʿūdun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,450],[2,450,780],[3,780,1790],[4,1790,5425]]}},{"name":"85:7","price":" 7. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers (i.e. burning them).","arabic":"وَهُمۡ عَلَىٰ مَا يَفۡعَلُونَ بِٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ شُهُودٞ","category":["85 (Al-Buruj)","Al-Buruj","Surah Al-Buruj"],"ayahNumber":5916,"juzNumber":30,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"wahum ʿalā mā yafʿalūna bil-mu'minīna shuhūdun ","translations":["And they","over","what","they were doing","to the believers","witnesses","(7)"],"transliterationArr":["wahum","ʿalā","mā","yafʿalūna","bil-mu'minīna","shuhūdun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,650],[2,650,1330],[3,1330,1730],[4,1730,3040],[5,3040,4550],[6,4550,8555]]}},{"name":"85:8","price":" 8. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allâh, the All-Mighty, Worthy of all Praise!","arabic":"وَمَا نَقَمُواْ مِنۡهُمۡ إِلَّآ أَن يُؤۡمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ ٱلۡعَزِيزِ ٱلۡحَمِيدِ","category":["85 (Al-Buruj)","Al-Buruj","Surah Al-Buruj"],"ayahNumber":5917,"juzNumber":30,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"wamā naqamū min'hum illā an yu'minū bil-lahi al-ʿazīzi al-ḥamīdi ","translations":["And not","they resented","[of] them","except","that","they believed","in Allah","the All-Mighty","the Praiseworthy","(8)"],"transliterationArr":["wamā","naqamū","min'hum","illā","an","yu'minū","bil-lahi","al-ʿazīzi","al-ḥamīdi",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,630],[2,630,1450],[3,1450,2250],[4,2250,4480],[5,4480,4959],[6,4959,6739],[7,6739,7839],[8,7839,8919],[9,8919,12274]]}},{"name":"85:9","price":" 9. To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth!

This incident happened during the period of the birth-year of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. Abrahah Al-Ashram was the governor of Yemen on behalf of the king of Ethiopia (as Yemen was a part of the Ethiopian kingdom). He (Abrahah) thought to build a house (like the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in San‘a (the capital of Yemen) and call the Arabs to perform the pilgrimage there in San‘a instead of the Ka‘bah (Al-Bait Al-Harâm) in Makkah, with the intention of diverting the trade and benefits from Makkah to Yemen. He presented his idea to the king of Ethiopia who agreed to his idea. So the house (church) was built and he named it Al-Qullais; there was no church of its like at that time. Then a man from the Quraish tribe of Makkah came there and was infuriated by it, so he relieved his nature (stools and urine) in it, soiled its walls and went away. When Abrahah Al-Ashram saw that, he could not control his anger and raised an army to invade Makkah and demolish the Ka‘bah. He had in that army thirteen elephants and amongst them was an elephant called Mahmûd which was the biggest of them. So that army proceeded and none amongst the Arab tribes that faced them (fought against them) but was killed and defeated, till it approached near Makkah. Then there took place negotiations between Abrahah Al-Ashram and the chief of Makkah (Abdul Muttalib bin Hâshim, the grandfather of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم), and it was concluded that Abrahah would restore the camels of Abdul Muttalib which he had taken away, and then he (Abrahah Al-Ashram) would decide himself as regards the Ka‘bah. Abdul Muttalib ordered the men of Makkah to evacuate the city and go to the top of the mountains along with their wives and children in case some harm should come to them from the invading oppressors. Then that army moved towards Makkah till they reached valley Muhassir. While the army was marching towards Makkah, in the middle of the valley, suddenly it was overtaken by flocks of birds, flocks after flocks, air-raiding that army with small stones slightly bigger than a lentil seed. There never fell a stone on a soldier except it dissolved his flesh and burst it into pieces. So they perished with a total destruction. Abrahah Al-Ashram fled away while his flesh was bursting into pieces till he died on the way (back to Yemen). Such was the victory bestowed by Allâh, (the All-Majestic, All-Powerful) to the people of Makkah and such was the protection provided by Him for His House (Ka‘bah in Makkah).

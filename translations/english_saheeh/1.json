In Arabic grammar both are intensive forms of \"merciful\" (i.e., extremely merciful) . A complimentary and comprehensive meaning is intended by using both together. Raḥmān is used only to describe Allāh, while raḥeem might be used to describe a person as well. The Prophet (ﷺ) was described in the Qur’ān as raḥeem. Raḥmān is above the human level (i.e., intensely merciful) . Since one usually understands intensity to be something of short duration, Allāh describes Himself also as raḥeem (i.e., continually merciful) . Raḥmān also carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Raḥeem includes the concept of speciality - especially and specifically merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Raḥmān is adjectival, referring to an attribute of Allāh and is part of His essence. Raḥeem is verbal, indicating what He does: i.e., bestowing and implementing mercy.","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"bis'mi al-lahi al-raḥmāni al-raḥīmi ","translations":["In (the) name","(of) Allah","the Most Gracious","the Most Merciful","(1)"],"transliterationArr":["bis'mi","al-lahi","al-raḥmāni","al-raḥīmi",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,580],[2,580,1409],[3,1409,2502],[4,2502,5840]]}},{"name":"1:2","price":"(2) [All] praise is [due] to Allāh, Lord[4] of the worlds -","arabic":"ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":2,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"[4]- When referring to Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) , the Arabic term \"rabb\" (translated as \"Lord\") includes all of the following meanings: \"owner, master, ruler, controller, sustainer, provider, guardian and caretaker.\"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"al-ḥamdu lillahi rabbi al-ʿālamīna ","translations":["All praises and thanks","(be) to Allah","the Lord","of the universe","(2)"],"transliterationArr":["al-ḥamdu","lillahi","rabbi","al-ʿālamīna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1000],[2,1000,1860],[3,1860,2490],[4,2490,5525]]}},{"name":"1:3","price":"(3) The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,","arabic":"ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":3,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"al-raḥmāni al-raḥīmi ","translations":["The Most Gracious","the Most Merciful","(3)"],"transliterationArr":["al-raḥmāni","al-raḥīmi",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1240],[3,1240,4565]]}},{"name":"1:4","price":"(4) Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.[5]","arabic":"مَٰلِكِ يَوۡمِ ٱلدِّينِ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":4,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"[5]- i.e., repayment and compensation for whatever was earned of good or evil during life on this earth.","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"māliki yawmi al-dīni ","translations":["(The) Master","(of the) Day","(of the) Judgment","(4)"],"transliterationArr":["māliki","yawmi","al-dīni",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,820],[2,820,1420],[3,1420,4585]]}},{"name":"1:5","price":"(5) It is You we worship and You we ask for help.","arabic":"إِيَّاكَ نَعۡبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسۡتَعِينُ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":5,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"iyyāka naʿbudu wa-iyyāka nastaʿīnu ","translations":["You Alone","we worship","and You Alone","we ask for help","(5)"],"transliterationArr":["iyyāka","naʿbudu","wa-iyyāka","nastaʿīnu",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,990],[2,990,1760],[3,1760,2880],[4,2880,6635]]}},{"name":"1:6","price":"(6) Guide us to the straight path -","arabic":"ٱهۡدِنَا ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلۡمُسۡتَقِيمَ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":6,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"ih'dinā al-ṣirāṭa al-mus'taqīma ","translations":["Guide us","(to) the path","the straight","(6)"],"transliterationArr":["ih'dinā","al-ṣirāṭa","al-mus'taqīma",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,740],[2,740,1640],[3,1640,5525]]}},{"name":"1:7","price":"(7) The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have earned [Your] anger or of those who are astray.","arabic":"صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ غَيۡرِ ٱلۡمَغۡضُوبِ عَلَيۡهِمۡ وَلَا ٱلضَّآلِّينَ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":7,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"ṣirāṭa alladhīna anʿamta ʿalayhim ghayri al-maghḍūbi ʿalayhim walā al-ḍālīna ","translations":["(The) path","(of) those","You have bestowed (Your) Favors","on them","not (of)","those who earned (Your) wrath","on themselves","and not","(of) those who go astray","(7)"],"transliterationArr":["ṣirāṭa","alladhīna","anʿamta","ʿalayhim","ghayri","al-maghḍūbi","ʿalayhim","walā","al-ḍālīna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,750],[2,750,1670],[3,1670,2690],[4,2690,3620],[5,3620,4210],[6,4210,5380],[7,5380,6380],[8,6380,6670],[9,6670,13175]]}}],"chapter":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah","Chapter Al-Fatihah","Fatihah","Surah Fatihah","Chapter Fatihah","Al Fatihah","Surah Al Fatihah","Chapter Al Fatihah","Surah 1","Chapter 1","The Opening","الفَاتِحَة"],"version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"}}

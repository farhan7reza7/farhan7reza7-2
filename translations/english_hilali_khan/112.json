When they returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. He said (to them), \"Ask him why he does so.\" They asked him and he said, \"I do so because it mentions the Qualities of the Most Gracious and I love to recite it (in my prayer).\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said (to them). \"Tell him that Allâh loves him.\" [Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No. 472].","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"lam yalid walam yūlad ","translations":["Not","He begets","and not","He is begotten","(3)"],"transliterationArr":["lam","yalid","walam","yūlad",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,430],[2,430,1050],[3,1050,1740],[4,1740,2915]]}},{"name":"112:4","price":" 4. \"And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.\"","arabic":"وَلَمۡ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدُۢ","category":["112 (Al-Ikhlas)","Al-Ikhlas","Surah Al-Ikhlas"],"ayahNumber":6225,"juzNumber":30,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","meta":{"transliteration":"walam yakun lahu kufuwan aḥadun ","translations":["And not","is","for Him","equivalent","any [one]","(4)"],"transliterationArr":["walam","yakun","lahu","kufuwan","aḥadun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,530],[2,530,1250],[3,1250,2080],[4,2080,3000],[5,3000,4695]]}}],"chapter":["112 (Al-Ikhlas)","Al-Ikhlas","Surah Al-Ikhlas","Chapter Al-Ikhlas","Ikhlas","Surah Ikhlas","Chapter Ikhlas","Al Ikhlas","Surah Al Ikhlas","Chapter Al Ikhlas","Surah 112","Chapter 112","The Sincerity","الإخلاص"],"version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"}}
